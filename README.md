## Project 1: Supplier Quality Dashboard

This industry-specific sample dashboard and accompanying report delve into a common supply chain challenge: supplier quality analysis. The analysis centers around two key performance indicators (KPIs): total defects and total downtime resulting from these defects. By examining these metrics, stakeholders can gain valuable insights into the root causes of quality issues and identify opportunities for process improvements, ultimately driving increased efficiency and reduced costs within the supply chain.

## Project 2: Sales Report Overview Dashboard

This comprehensive nature of the Store Sales built-in sample report and semantic model makes it a powerful tool for retail businesses. By leveraging this data-rich resource, organizations can gain a deeper understanding of their sales performance, identify areas for improvement, and make data-driven decisions to enhance overall business performance and profitability. The semantic model underlying the report adds an extra layer of depth to the analysis. By establishing relationships between various data points, such as store locations, product categories, and sales figures, the model enables more sophisticated queries and insights. This can help businesses uncover hidden patterns, identify cross-selling opportunities, and make more informed strategic decisions.
